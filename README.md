# [Saxo OpenAPI JavaScript Sample Repository](https://saxobank.github.io/openapi-samples-js/)

This repository contains sample files demonstrating OpenApi interactions in JavaScript.

Plain JavaScript is used. No libraries, free of depencencies, to simplify the code. Reuse of code is not done, so the code behind every button is more or less complete.

JavaScript developers might see a lot of improvements in de code, for example in the loops. However, using for loops (for example) for demonstration is understandable for all developers, while a map statement might be difficult.

The HTML has no headers, this is on purpose and can be ignored. The reason is that the HTML is embedded in a MarkDown document, showing the example within the explanation of the pattern.

This is a work in progress. Suggestions/comments/PRs are welcome.
