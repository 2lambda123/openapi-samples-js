# Saxo OpenAPI JavaScript Sample Repository

This is a repository to demo common patterns on using the Saxo OpenApi is JavaScript.

Plain JavaScript is used. No libraries, to simplify the code. Reuse of code is not done, so the code behind every button is more or less complete.

The HTML has no headers, this is on purpose and can be ignored. The reason is that the HTML is embedded in a MarkDown document, showing the example within the explanation of the pattern.

This is a work in progress. Suggestions/comments/PRs are welcome.
