# PHP sample for Code Flow Authentication

This sample shows how to retrieve the token using PHP. It uses the [file_get_contents](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php) function, which is old, but works in all PHP configurations.

When your configuration supports cURL, please take a look at the [PHP Sample Repository of Saxobank](https://github.com/saxobank/openapi-samples-php) for support of GZip encoding and HTTP/2.
