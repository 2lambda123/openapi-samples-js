# Client-side Sample for realtime quotes

This is an example on retrieving realtime quotes.

It contains an example using JSON messages and the more complex, but slightly faster [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview).

For ProtoBuf, the library [protobuf.js](https://github.com/dcodeio/protobuf.js) is used.
